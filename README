This is a simple attempt to implement a general string evolver genetic algorithm .

any suggestions are welcome

First trial would include tournament approach. a population of 10 strings and a reference string of lenght 10.
God knows how long that will take . 

#########
As of now , the implementation runs . Very poor implementation , output is mostly random , more like a bruteforce method. Need better approaches in choosing parameters . Almost all parameters hard coded as of now . Should change that
